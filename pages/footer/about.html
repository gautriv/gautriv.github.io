<h4> Tell me about your education? </h4>

<p>Life's journey often unfolds in the most unexpected ways, casting us into roles we never envisioned. As I graduated from Army School, MHOW (MP), the path ahead seemed preordained – a stereotypical trajectory for a middle-class Indian youth: engineering. Armed with a degree in Electronics and Communication by June 2011, I was meant to fit into the mold I had grown up observing. Little did I know that this path, while conventional, wasn't aligned with my inner compass.</p>

<p>I navigated into the professional world, a realm teeming with uncertainty and competition. Strangely, despite my qualification, I found myself devoid of relevant experience in programming, electronics, or communication. The rejection emails started trickling in, each "unfortunately" a resounding echo of doubt. Frustration became a constant companion, shadowing my aspirations. The idea of call centers even crossed my mind as a pragmatic detour, a haven from the barrage of rejections. Yet, as quickly as it emerged, that notion dissipated, leaving me at a crossroads.</p>

<p>Then, like a whisper amidst the chaos, MPS's call disrupted my wavering contemplations in August 2011. Serendipity seemed to have intervened, offering me a lifeline I hadn't anticipated. This marked the juncture from which I never looked back.</p>

<p>The world of programming languages and technology, a realm that once seemed alien, now beckoned invitingly. With unwavering determination, I delved into coding, electronics, and communication – domains I had once thought were beyond my reach. Like an artist with a chisel, I carved away at self-doubt, honing my skills and molding my identity.</p>


<p>Years later, I stand as a testament to the extraordinary power of seizing the unexpected. The narrative has shifted; the once-inexperienced graduate has evolved into a tech-savvy professional. My story is one of metamorphosis, where the mundane cocoon of uncertainty gave way to wings of self-assuredness. It's a reminder that life's most remarkable chapters often emerge from the unplanned paragraphs, written with the ink of resilience and the parchment of opportunity.</p>

<h4>Engineering and then technical writing, I'm confused? </h4>

<p>So am I :) Jokes apart, I didn't know any programming languages and wasn't particularly skilled in electronics. It was through the grace of my mum that I secured a career in Technical Writing.</p>


<h4>What about your family?</h4>
<p>I'm married and have a child.</p>
