Technical writing is a thriving sector, with demand expected to climb 7% between 2022 and 2032, faster than the average for all vocations. That is because of rising demand for technical products and services, and it is also because of the advent of new technologies that necessitate technical documentation.

Here are some interesting statistics about technical writing:

* According to the [Technical Writers of America](https://www.stc.org/publications/salary-database/) 2022 poll, 82% of technical writers believe that the need for their abilities is increasing.

* According to a 2023 [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2023-content-marketing-trends/) poll, 91% of marketing professionals believe technical writing is critical to their content marketing strategy.

* According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-mathematical-occupations/technical-writers.htm), employment of technical writers will grow by 7 percent between 2022 and 2032, faster than the average for all occupations.

* According to [MarketsandMarkets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/technical-writing-market-2022.html), the global technical writing business will be worth $15.7 billion by 2027.

Technical writers need to be informed of the most recent developments in the industry to stay on top of the game. The following are some of the main trends in technical writing for 2023:

## AI and automation

Many sectors, including technical writing, are being transformed by automation and artificial intelligence (AI). Many technical writing activities may be automated using AI-powered solutions, such as:

* Creating preliminary documentation

* Document translation into many languages

* Making interactive content, like simulations and lessons

Technical writers may therefore be able to concentrate on more strategic responsibilities, such as coming up with content strategies and producing documentation that is tailored to the requirements of certain audiences.

Imagine you are a technical writer for a software company. Using AI-powered technology, you may produce a draft of the user manual for the new product from your company. Once the first draft is complete, you may review it and make necessary adjustments. As a result of the time and work you would have saved, you may focus on other tasks.

For example, [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/) is one well-known AI-powered writing tool that we can use to proofread content for grammar errors, make it simpler to read, and suggest alternative terms and synonyms. Additionally, ProWritingAid may be used to create custom style guides, guaranteeing that all documentation is consistent and follows the organization’s branding rules.

## UX Design

User experience (UX) design is the process of developing products and services that are clear and easy to use. Using UX design principles, you may, for instance, create a user handbook with clear, succinct sections. To aid readers in understanding the text, you may also utilize illustrations, diagrams, and other forms of visualization.

For example, [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a open-source tool that allows you to create easy-to-use documentation in a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF, EPUB, and more. With MkDocs, you can add search capabilities, themes, and other interactive elements to your documentation. 

## Content reuse

If you’re a technical writer, you understand how critical it is to reuse knowledge across several platforms and media, allowing you to create and update documentation with less time and effort.

For example, [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) is a fantastic open-source document management system that allows you to produce and distribute content in a variety of forms, including HTML, PDFs, and even EPUBs. Furthermore, Sphinx provides several opportunities to reuse material, such as cross-referencing and incorporating files from other projects.

## Collaboration

Technical writers are becoming increasingly involved with product-development team members such as engineers, designers, and product managers.Thus ensuring that the documentation is correct, up to date, and satisfies the needs of all users.

For example, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) are all open-source collaboration technologies that technical writers may use to collaborate on documentation projects. Team members may use these tools to keep track of documentation changes, provide feedback, and integrate changes into a single document.

I have a comprehensive course on [Git for technical writers](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/gitfortechnicalwriters/) and [API documentation](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/apidocumentation/) (new content every week). If you are interested, make the most of it. It is free, and you can access it at your own pace.

## Emerging technologies
Aside from the overall tendencies, numerous developing technologies are impacting technical writing. Here are a couple of such examples:

* **Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR):** VR and AR may be utilized to produce interactive documentation that allows users to have a more immersive experience with items and concepts.

* **Internet of Things (IoT):** Technical documentation is required due to the advent of a new generation of gadgets and connected devices. Technical writers must acquire new abilities and specializations to handle these complex systems.

* **Data science:** Technical writers use data science to improve their understanding of client behavior. The readability, usability, and efficacy of technical writing might be enhanced using such information.

For example, [Unity](https://unity.com/) is a game engine that you can use to generate interactive virtual reality and augmented reality content. You can use Unity to build a wide range of VR and AR experiences, including product demonstrations, training simulations, and educational games.

## How I'm using the trends discussed in this blog post in my own technical writing?

I'm devoted to remaining current on technical writing trends and applying them to my own work. Here are some examples of how I accomplish this:

* I use the Vale linter to enhance the uniformity and quality documents.
* I apply UX design concepts to generate better user-friendly documents.
* I use a modular documentation approach.
* I collaborate using GitHub and GitLab.
* I use CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and publish my documents.
