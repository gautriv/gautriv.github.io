Technical writing is a booming field, with demand for technical writers projected to grow 7% from 2022 to 2032, faster than the average for all occupations. This is due to the increasing demand for technical products and services, as well as the emergence of new technologies that require technical documentation.

Here are some interesting facts on technical writing:

* According to a 2022 survey by the [Technical Writers of America](https://www.stc.org/publications/salary-database/), 82% of technical writers are experiencing an increase in demand for their services.

* A 2023 study by [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2023-content-marketing-trends/) found that 91% of marketing professionals believe that technical writing is important for their content marketing strategy.

* The [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-mathematical-occupations/technical-writers.htm) projects that the employment of technical writers will grow 7 percent from 2022 to 2032, faster than the average for all occupations.

* The global technical writing market is expected to reach $15.7 billion by 2027, according to a report by [MarketsandMarkets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/technical-writing-market-2022.html).


To stay ahead of the curve, technical writers need to be aware of the latest trends in the field. Here are some of the top technical writing trends in 2023:

## AI and automation

Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are transforming many industries, and technical writing is no exception. AI-powered tools can be used to automate a variety of technical writing tasks, such as:

* Generating first drafts of documentation

* Translating documentation into different languages

* Creating interactive content, such as tutorials and simulations


This can free up technical writers to focus on more strategic tasks, such as developing content strategies and creating documentation that meets the needs of specific audiences.

Imagine you're a technical writer for a software company. You could use AI-powered tools to generate a first draft of the user manual for your company's new product. Once the first draft is complete, you could review it and make any necessary edits. This would save you a lot of time and effort, and would allow you to focus on other important tasks.

For example, [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/) is a popular AI-powered writing assistant that can be used to check for grammar errors, improve the readability of text, and suggest synonyms and other word choices. ProWritingAid can also be used to create custom style guides, which can help to ensure that all documentation is consistent and meets the company's branding standards.

## UX Design

User experience (UX) design is the process of designing products and services that are easy to use and understand. You can use UX design principles to create a user manual that is divided into clear and concise sections. You could also use images, diagrams, and other visuals to help users understand the information.

For example, [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a free and open-source documentation generator that can be used to create user-friendly documentation in a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF, and EPUB. MkDocs includes a number of features for creating UX-friendly documentation, such as the ability to create themes, add search functionality, and include interactive elements.

## Content reuse

Technical writers are increasingly finding ways to reuse content across different formats and platforms. This can help to reduce the time and effort it takes to create and maintain documentation.

For example, [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) is an open-source documentation management system that can be used to create and publish documentation in a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF, and EPUB. Sphinx also includes a number of features for reusing content, such as the ability to create cross-references and include files from other Sphinx projects.

## Collaboration

Technical writers are increasingly collaborating with other members of the product team, such as engineers, designers, and product managers. This helps to ensure that the documentation is accurate, up-to-date, and meets the needs of all users.

For example, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) are all open-source collaboration tools that can be used by technical writers to collaborate on documentation projects. These tools allow team members to track changes to documentation, provide feedback, and merge changes into a single document.

I have a full-fledged course on [Git for technical writers](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/gitfortechnicalwriters/) and [API documentation](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/apidocumentation/) (new content added every week). If you are interested, make the most of it. It is free and you can access it at your own pace.

## Emerging technologies
In addition to the general trends listed above, there are also a number of emerging technologies that are impacting technical writing. These include:

* **Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR):** VR and AR can be used to create interactive documentation that allows users to experience products and concepts in a more immersive way.

* **Internet of Things (IoT):** The IoT is creating a new generation of connected devices that require technical documentation. Technical writers need to develop new skills and expertise to create documentation for these complex systems.

* **Data science:** Technical writers are using data science to better understand how users interact with documentation. This information can be used to improve the readability, usability, and effectiveness of technical writing.

For example, [Unity](https://unity.com/) is a game engine that can be used to create interactive VR and AR content. Unity can be used to create a variety of different types of VR and AR experiences, such as product demos, training simulations, and educational games.

## How I'm using the trends discussed in this blog post in my own technical writing?

I'm personally committed to staying up-to-date on the latest trends in technical writing and incorporating them into my own work. Here are a few examples of how I'm doing this:

* I use the Vale linter to improve the quality and consistency of my documents.
* I apply UX design principles to create documentation that is more user-friendly.
* I use a modular documentation approach.
* I collaborate using GitHub and GitLab.
* I use CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and publish my documents.
