## The Power of Specificity

Before we dive into the wonderful world of prompts, remember this golden rule: the more specific your prompt, the better your output.

## Formats

ChatGPT, the shapeshifter of text, can weave diverse formats, from articles and essays to book outlines and social media posts. Simply specify the format you desire in your prompt.
