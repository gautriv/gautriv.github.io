"Release notes are like love letters to your users. They should be clear, concise, and informative." 
<br> 
                    - [Unknown]

Now, I won't make you guess who that mysterious "unknown" is. In the world of technical writing, where there are many unknowns, we should be wary of them. If we're not, our readers might feel like they're drowning in an ocean of information with no life raft. And let's be honest, if your readers suffer, so does your product.

_For some of you,_<br>
_Who are new,_<br>
_Want to know_<br>
_What are release no(tes)?_<br>

(See, I'm trying hard to make it rhyme.)

Release notes are an integral part of any software development process. They communicate changes to users and help them understand how new features and functionality work. Over the years, the landscape of release notes has evolved significantly, from lengthy paragraphs to concise bullet points, and now to data and design-driven approaches.

I've observed a recent trend where the interest of users in reading release notes is steadily declining.

Why, you ask? Let's delve into some Facts and Statistics:

- According to a recent survey by [TechSmith](https://surveyjs.io/changelog), 78% of users emphasize the importance of release notes.
- However, [Atlassian](https://amoeboids.com/blog/release-notes-best-practices-engagement-and-distribution/) reports that only<sup>#</sup> 63% of users admit to reading release notes regularly.
- According to a study by [UX Movement](https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-release-notes-3e8c8c785231), only<sup>#</sup> 52% of users find release notes helpful in learning about new features. 
- According to a survey by [G2](https://documentation.g2.com/docs/release-notes), a mere<sup>#</sup> 45% of users claim that release notes have been instrumental in troubleshooting problems. 

                                                                        # My interpretation

## The traditional approach

The decline in user engagement may be attributed to the traditional method of composing release notes, which involves crafting extensive paragraphs detailing each modification. While informative, this approach can prove challenging for users to assimilate. Additionally, the creation and maintenance of traditional release notes can be time-consuming.

Now, what I'm about to share is already embraced by some industry pioneers, and I'm shedding light on the same. To enhance the information conveyed in release notes, the tech writing industry has adopted a new approach - the Data and Design-Driven Approach.

## Data and Design-Driven Approach

In response to the shortcomings of the traditional method, a new era emerged—one where data and design took center stage. This method employs data and analytics to understand what users want to see in release notes. Then, it utilizes design principles to craft release notes that are not only informative but also engaging and easy to understand.

## Benefits of a data and design-driven approach to release notes

- **Improved user satisfaction:**  Imagine release notes that are not just informative but also enjoyable to read! Users appreciate this kind of content, and it leaves them more satisfied.
- **Increased adoption of new features:** When users get how the new features roll, they're more likely to jump on the bandwagon. It's like introducing them to the cool kids at the tech party.
- **Reduced support costs:** Say goodbye to those support hotline charges! Users who can easily navigate through release notes are less likely to bug support for help.

## How to Create Data and Design-Driven Release Notes

1. **Start with user research:** Start by talking to users. What's their jam? What do they want in those release notes? Conduct interviews and surveys to unveil the mysteries.
2. **Use data to prioritize changes:** Use the magic of data to figure out what changes users are buzzing about. No crystal ball is needed—just a good dose of analytics.
3. **Design release notes for usability:** Make your release notes a work of art. Use design tricks to make them easy on the eyes and brain-friendly for a quick scan.
4. **Test release notes with users:** Before you unleash your notes on the world, run them by a group of users. Make sure it's not just you who thinks they're awesome.

## Examples of Data and Design-Driven Release Notes

- **Google cloud release notes:** [Google cloud release notes](https://cloud.google.com/release-notes) use a data-driven approach to identify the most important changes to include in each release. The release notes also use design principles to make the information easy to read and scan.
- **Mozilla Firefox release notes:**  [Mozilla Firefox release notes](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/119.0/releasenotes/) use a design-driven approach to make the information easy to understand. The release notes include videos and screenshots to help users visualize the latest changes.
- **Microsoft Windows release notes:** [Microsoft Windows release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-11-version-23h2) use a data-driven approach to identify the most common user-reported issues. The release notes also include links to support articles and documentation to help users resolve issues they might encounter.
