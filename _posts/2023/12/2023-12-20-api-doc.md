faqs:
  - question: "Do I need prior coding experience to create REST APIs?"
    answer: "While some JavaScript knowledge is helpful, this tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly. We explain each step in detail and provide code explanations to help newcomers understand the concepts."
  - question: "What is Swagger and why is it important for API documentation?"
    answer: "Swagger is an open-source framework for documenting APIs. It's important because it creates interactive documentation that allows developers to understand and test your API without additional tools. Swagger makes your API more accessible, reduces onboarding time, and improves adoption rates."
  - question: "Can I use this approach for production APIs?"
    answer: "The approach taught in this tutorial provides the foundation for building production APIs, but production environments would require additional considerations like security measures, error handling, database integration, and performance optimization."
  - question: "How does REST API design differ from other API architectures?"
    answer: "REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs use standard HTTP methods and are stateless. Unlike SOAP APIs which use XML and have strict contracts, or GraphQL which allows clients to request exactly what they need, REST APIs are more straightforward to implement and widely used due to their simplicity and compatibility with the web's architecture."
  - question: "Is Node.js the best platform for building REST APIs?"
    answer: "Node.js is excellent for REST APIs due to its non-blocking I/O, making it efficient for handling multiple concurrent requests. However, the 'best' platform depends on your specific needs. Python (with Flask/Django), Java (with Spring), and C# (with ASP.NET) are also popular alternatives with their own strengths."

## Prerequisites - The Enchanted Preparations
As we begin our magical journey, picture yourself adorned in wizarding robes, standing before the majestic gates of Hogwarts â€“ our code school. But before we can cast spells, we must complete our magical prerequisites.

Regardless of your operating system, open your terminal and:

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
* Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).


## Procedures - The Code Incantations

1. Create a directory for your project. Let's name it `rest_api`. In your terminal, run `mkdir rest_api`.
2. Navigate to the directory you just created using `cd rest_api`.
3. Initialize your project by running `npm init`. For simplicity, press Enter until you're back on the path. This step creates a `node_modules` directory and generates `package-lock.json` and `package.json` files. In the terminal, you can verify this by running `ls`, or alternatively, open your project in Visual Studio Code. If you're not comfortable with the terminal, don't worryâ€”feel free to open your project in Visual Studio Code. I'll continue with the Terminal for now.

4. Create an empty JavaScript file named `index.js`. If you are working on the Terminal run, `echo index.js`. 
5. Install Express by running `npm install express`.
6. Open the `index.js` file. If you are on terminal enter `vim index.js` and if you are on Visual Studio code, simply open it and paste the following code:

     ```js
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     const port = 3000;

     app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
     });
     ```

     {% include note.html content="If you get errors when running `vim index.js`, it means `vim` is not installed on your system. Install `vim` and run the command again." %}

     {% include note.html content="Using `app.use(express.json())`, we tell Express to parse incoming JSON requests and make the data available in `req.body`." %}

     <br>
     Once upon a time in the coding kingdom, a developer wanted to create a special place on the internet. They decided to use Express.js, a helpful tool that makes building websites easier.
     <br>

     <strong>Getting the Toolbox (Importing Express.js):</strong> Our hero started by getting a toolbox called Express.js using `const express = require('express');`. This toolbox has all sorts of tools to help build websites. The developer named it 'express'.

     <br>

     <strong>Setting Up the Workspace (Creating Express App Instance):</strong> With the toolbox ready, our hero created a workspace, a space to build their website. The line `const app = express();` creates an instance of the Express application. They called it 'app'. This is where all the website-building would happen. In other words, this `app` variable will be used to configure the server and define routes.

     <br>

     <strong>Choosing a Door (Setting a Port Number):</strong> Every website needs a door for people to come in. Our hero chose the number 3000 as the door number. So, people could visit the website at http://localhost:3000. The code sets a port number for the server to listen on with `const port = 3000;`. The server will be accessible through http://localhost:3000/.

     <br>

     <strong>Opening for Business (Starting the Server):</strong> The hero opened the door and let the website start. They used a special command, `app.listen(port, () => {...});`, to make the website live. The hero also left a message saying, "Hey, the website is running at http://localhost:3000!". The arrow function `() => {...}` is a callback that logs a message to the console once the server is successfully started.

     <br>

     <strong>The Website Is Open (Server Running Message):</strong> Now, the website was open for everyone to visit. People could type http://localhost:3000 in their browsers and see what our hero built. The server will keep running until manually stopped or in case of an error. The console log inside the callback provides a message indicating that the server is running and on which URL.

     </details>
     <br>

7. (Optional) If you're using Vim, save and close the file by typing `:wq`.
8. Launch your terminal and run `node index.js`. If everything works as expected, you'll see a message confirming the server is running on http://localhost:3000. Copy this address and paste it into your web browser.
9. What is the result? Encounter a "Cannot GET /"? Excellent!

### Creating an Enhanced POST Endpoint

10. Let's elevate our code by creating an enhanced POST Endpoint.

     ```js
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     const port = 3000;

     // Define the users array
     const users = [];

     // Middleware to parse JSON body
     app.use(express.json());

     // GET endpoint to retrieve users
     app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
     // Logic to retrieve and send users
     res.json(users);
     });

     // POST endpoint to add a new user
     app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
     const { name, email } = req.body;

     if (!name || !email) {
     return res.status(400).send('Name and email are required');
     }

     // Logic to add the user to the array
     const newUser = {
     id: users.length + 1,
     name,
     email,
     };

     users.push(newUser);

     res.status(201).json(newUser);
     });

     // Start the server
     app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
     });

     ```

     <details>
     <summary><strong>Expand for code explanation</strong></summary>

     <br>

     Continuing the developer's journey in the coding kingdom, our hero extended their creation, weaving a more intricate tale of a dynamic and interactive place on the internet using Express.js. The developer not only built a place but also added functionality to manage a community within it.

     <br>

     <strong>Expanding the Kingdom with Interactive Features:</strong> After establishing the initial internet haven, our innovative developer decided to transform it into a lively community. To accomplish this, they introduced new features to the Express.js kingdom.

     <br>

     <strong>Gathering the Inhabitants (Defining the Users Array):</strong> Our hero recognized the need to track the inhabitants of the growing community. Introducing a new array called `users` using `const users = [];`, the hero started keeping records of the community members. This array would store details about each inhabitant in the kingdom.

     <br>

     <strong>Creating a Common Language (Middleware to Parse JSON Body):</strong> To facilitate communication within the community, our developer implemented a middleware using `app.use(express.json());`. This feature allowed the community members to speak a common language by parsing incoming messages in JSON format.

     <br>

     <strong>Opening the Community Records (GET Endpoint to Retrieve Users):</strong> Our hero wanted the community to be transparent, allowing others to explore its members. They created a pathway at `/users` with a special gate that responded to GET requests. When someone ventured to this path, the hero opened the community records (`users` array) to share the diverse profiles of its members.

     <br>

     <strong>Welcoming New Residents (POST Endpoint to Add a New User):</strong> The hero wanted to welcome new residents to the community. To achieve this, they crafted another pathway at `/users` for POST requests. If a visitor brought a name and an email, they were warmly welcomed as new members. The hero diligently recorded their information in the community records (`users` array) and offered a unique identifier (`id`) as a token of membership.

     <br>

     <strong>Reiterating the Grand Announcement (Start the Server):</strong> With every new enhancement, our hero proudly reiterated the grand announcement, declaring the continued expansion of the interactive community using `app.listen(port, () => {...});`. Once again, the message echoed through the digital realm, proclaiming, "The vibrant community is open for exploration at http://localhost:3000!"

     </details>
     <br>


### Test the POST Endpoint

Now, let's test our API using Postman.

11. Open Postman, navigate to **Collections > REST API basics: CRUD, test, & variable > Post data**.

     <img src="/assets/postmanone.png" alt="Postman Navigation" style="max-width: 100%;" height="auto">

12. Send a POST request to http://localhost:3000/users with a JSON body containing "name" and "email" fields.

     ```json
     {
     "name": "John Doe",
     "email": "john.doe@example.com"
     }
     ```

     <img src="/assets/postmantwo.png" alt="Postman Testing Data" style="max-width: 100%;" height="auto">

13. Select **Send**. What do you see in the Response section? If you don't see the expected response, close your server and restart it by running `node index.js`.

     <img src="/assets/response.png" alt="Postman Response" style="max-width: 100%;" height="auto">


### Documenting API

14. In your project terminal, run the following command to install the required packages.

    ```js
    npm install swagger-jsdoc swagger-ui-express
    ```
15. Let's update our endpoint to add Swagger definition.

     ```js
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     const port = 3000;
     const swaggerJSDoc = require('swagger-jsdoc');
     const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express');

     // Swagger definition
     const swaggerOptions = {
     definition: {
     openapi: '3.0.0',
     info: {
          title: 'Your API',
          version: '1.0.0',
     },
     },
     apis: [__filename], // Point to the current file
     };

     const swaggerSpec = swaggerJSDoc(swaggerOptions);

     app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerSpec));

     // Define the users array
     const users = [];

     // Middleware to parse JSON body
     app.use(express.json());

     // GET endpoint to retrieve users
     /**
     * @swagger
     * /users:
     *   get:
     *     summary: Get a list of users
     *     responses:
     *       200:
     *         description: Successful response
     *         content:
     *           application/json:
     *             example: [{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith"}]
     */
     app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
     // Logic to retrieve and send users
     res.json(users);
     });

     // POST endpoint to add a new user
     /**
     * @swagger
     * /users:
     *   post:
     *     summary: Add a new user
     *     requestBody:
     *       content:
     *         application/json:
     *           example: {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}
     *     responses:
     *       201:
     *         description: User created successfully
     *         content:
     *           application/json:
     *             example: {"id": 3, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}
     *       400:
     *         description: Bad Request
     *         content:
     *           text/plain:
     *             example: "Name and email are required"
     */
     app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
     const { name, email } = req.body;

     if (!name || !email) {
     return res.status(400).send('Name and email are required');
     }

     // Logic to add the user to the array
     const newUser = {
     id: users.length + 1,
     name,
     email,
     };

     users.push(newUser);

     res.status(201).json(newUser);
     });

     // Start the server
     app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
     });

     ```

     <br>

     Once upon a time in the coding kingdom, our resourceful developer continued their journey, building upon the foundation of the Express.js kingdom. But this time, they added a dash of magic with Swagger, a tool that effortlessly documents the kingdom's APIs.

     <br>

     <strong>Extending the Kingdom's Reach (Importing Express.js and Swagger):</strong> Expanding their toolkit, our hero summoned Express.js once again using `const express = require('express');`. Additionally, they introduced Swagger to the realm with `const swaggerJSDoc = require('swagger-jsdoc');` and `const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express');`.

     <br>

     <strong>Designing New Blueprints (Swagger Definition):</strong> With the magic of Swagger, our hero designed new blueprints for the kingdom's APIs. This time, they added more details to the Swagger options, specifying the API title and version. The incantation looked like this: `const swaggerOptions = {...};`, and the enchanting Swagger specification emerged with `const swaggerSpec = swaggerJSDoc(swaggerOptions);`.

     <br>

     <strong>Creating a Seamless Gateway (Swagger UI Middleware):</strong> To provide a seamless experience for visitors, our hero crafted a new gateway at `/api-docs` using `app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerSpec));`. This gateway, powered by Swagger UI, allowed anyone to easily explore and understand the magical APIs of the kingdom.

     <br>

     <strong>Introducing New Inhabitants (Defining the Users Array):</strong> The hero continued to populate the kingdom, introducing a new array called `users` using `const users = [];`. This array would hold information about the growing number of inhabitants within the API kingdom.

     <br>

     <strong>Enabling Clear Communication (Middleware to Parse JSON Body):</strong> To ensure clear communication between the kingdom and the outside world, our hero reinforced the gateway using `app.use(express.json());`. This enhancement enabled messages in JSON format to seamlessly flow into and out of the API kingdom.

     <br>

     <strong>Opening Updated Census Records (GET Endpoint to Retrieve Users):</strong> The hero extended the pathways for exploration, maintaining the `/users` route with a special gate that responded to GET requests. When curious visitors ventured to this path, the hero graciously opened the updated census records (`users` array) to share the ever-expanding information.

     <br>

     <strong>Welcoming New Citizens (POST Endpoint to Add a New User):</strong> With the kingdom flourishing, our hero set up a welcoming pathway at `/users` for POST requests. If a visitor brought a name and an email, they were warmly welcomed as new citizens. The hero diligently recorded their details in the census records (`users` array) and bestowed upon them a special token (`id`) as a symbol of their newfound citizenship.

     <br>

     <strong>Repeating the Grand Announcement (Start the Server):</strong> With every enchantment in place, our hero repeated the grand announcement, proclaiming the continued expansion of the API kingdom using `app.listen(port, () => {...});`. Once again, the message echoed through the digital realm, declaring, "The API kingdom is open for exploration at http://localhost:3000!"

     </details>
     <br>


16. When you run your server (`node index.js`), access the Swagger documentation at http://localhost:3000/api-docs. This page offers clear and interactive documentation of your API, including endpoints, parameters, request/response examples, and more.

     <img src="/assets/swagger.png" alt="Swagger output" style="max-width: 100%;" height="auto">


You did it! You've become a coder, a documentarian, and a magician â€“ all in one go. Your API is not just a set of endpoints; it's a masterpiece, a testament to your newfound skills.

<br>
As you journey through the tech realm, remember this: APIs aren't just about coding. They're about telling a story, creating an experience. So, go forth, write beautiful APIs, document them with Swagger, and sprinkle a bit of humor along the way.

In the words of our digital sages: "May your code be bug-free, your documentation crystal clear, and your laughter contagious." Until next time, happy coding, and may the tech gods be ever in your favor!
