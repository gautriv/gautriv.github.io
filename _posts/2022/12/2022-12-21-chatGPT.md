ChatGPT is one of the most popular topics right now. It has only been a few months since its release, and people are still in awe of what it is capable of. It is also breaking records, with over 1 million users signing up in 5 days, outpacing Netflix, Facebook, and Instagram. You will no longer be Googling solutions to problems because ChatGPT breaks them down and explains how they work in minute detail. As a result, people may wonder how relevant Google will be in the future. But what exactly is ChatGPT, and what makes it so powerful?

## A brief history and definition
**GPT** in ChatGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which means that this artificial intelligence model has already been trained. Let's dig deeper into this.

### Pre-trained
What is the most effective way to explain cats to a child? You show them the photograph and point out any cats you see, whether they are in the basement, on the street, or in a park. When this is done repeatedly, the child realises that, yes, that is a cat. That is exactly how AI models are trained. Instead of 10-20 examples, you present a number of data points that differ in shape, size, colour, and appearance. However, this is where biases can creep in. This "number of data points" figure is not conclusive. If the data provided to AI models is incomplete or does not include everything, an AI's answer to the question "what is cat?" will be puzzling and incorrect.

**Google Brain** created Transformer in 2007. In 2015, OpenAI (a new company) chose the Transformer approach and began work on ChatGPI, which was released in 2022. People who believe it is some revolutionary invention that poses a threat to Google should take a seat, because Google invented the **T** in ChatGPT.

Google must be like - Don't teach your father how to cook.

ChatGPT was developed by the same team that developed OpenAI, which is now influencing some intriguing technologies. They've been working on powerful engines like the Codex. Codex powers GitHub co-pilot and is already being used by many of us in our day-to-day coding on VS code. If you look closely, you might notice the early stages of ChatGPT, in which users enter prompts and receive results from an AI-generated system.

Another example is DALL.E 2, a picture generator based on your input. Many distinct representations of a spaceman riding a horse can be found here, as well as many other instances, some of which go beyond traditional art. ChatGPT is thus a novel method of prompting an AI to solve or answer a question or prompt in a human-like manner, very different from anything else we've seen before. In case you didn't know, GPT chat is completely free.

## How to use ChatGPT?
If you want to try it out, go to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), create a new account, and then select the chat [GPT interface](https://chat.openai.com/). I like the design. It's simple, and it shows you some examples. It also displays some of ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations.

Some of these capabilities are quite powerful. Things like remembering what a user said in a conversation and providing follow-up corrections.

## My first conversation?
The first thing I wanted to see was if it could show me how to make a Jira board, which it did with some caveats. The response was nearly flawless. I asked if it could provide me with some best practises because I had never created a Jira board before. It not only wrote the procedures for me to copy and paste into a Jira tutorial, but it also explained the codes, filters, and strings that we use.

In addition, I pasted the content of this article into ChatGPT and requested peer review. The response I received astounded me. Among the comments I received were thoughts about the structure of my blog, as well as gaps in it. For a brief moment, I mistook AI for someone on the backend reading my article and providing this feedback. It makes me wonder about the future of content development because this could be used as a personal content checker.

It has a lot of relevance outside of content development, given that ChatGPT applies to just about whatever we want to create. Would you like a list of carbohydrate-free foods? It provides a list that includes omelets, shrimp, and grilled chicken. I went a step further and asked if it could create a grocery list based on those meals, and voila! It provided me a list of the groceries I needed and even indented them to make them easier to read.

## Is ChatGPT better than Google? ChatGPT vs Google? 
ChatGPT is still in its early stages; it has a long way to go before we say it can threaten Google. Don't forget that Google has **[LaMDA2](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/)**, which, according to what I've read, is one step ahead of ChaGPT. Why?

If you ask ChatGPT to write an essay about a five-legged horse, it will do so without question. Lambda2, on the other hand, will ask questions, try to understand your problem, and only then will it provide you with answers.

However, because LaMDA2 is still in the works, ChatGPT has the upper hand for the time being.

| Google relies on keywords to provide search results, and the results are plenty for a given keyword. | ChatGPT can read your entire sentence and process it to provide you with the exact result/answer.                                        |
| Google search does not remember user's patterns and preferences.                                     | ChatGPT can remember your conversations with it. And the next time you ask a question, it will try to be more specific in its responses. |

I believe that GPT chat is here to stay. It will become a part of our daily lives in the same way that Google has. It may revolutionise many industries and technlogies once they fully utilise it. That is just my opinion. What are your thoughts? Please let me know in the comments section below.
