<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

## Prerequisites
- A json file, for example, [search.json](https://github.com/gautriv/gautriv.github.io/blob/main/search.json).
- HTML elements for search bar, for example, [search.html](https://github.com/gautriv/gautriv.github.io/blob/main/_includes/search.html).
- A JavaScript file, for example, [search-script.js](https://github.com/gautriv/gautriv.github.io/blob/main/js/search-script.js).

## Procedures
1. Add **search.json** at your home location. The location where you have your index.html file.
2. Add **search-script.js** in your js folder if you have one, otherwise add it at your home location.
3. Add **search.html** in your `_includes` folder.

    {% include note.html content="Update the **search.html** file with the exact location of **search.json** and **search-script.js** files." %} 

4. Add **search.html** at the location where you want your system to display the search bar or functionality.
