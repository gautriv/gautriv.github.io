faqs:
  - question: "Where can I test this AI writing assistant?"  
    answer: "Try it here: [huggingface.co/gtrivedi/style-guide-checker](https://huggingface.co/gtrivedi/style-guide-checker), or use the [Colab notebook](https://github.com/gtrivedi88/style-guide-base/blob/master/resources/style-guide_base.ipynb) for your own training and tests."
  - question: "Can I add new training data?"  
    answer: "Yes! Fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gtrivedi88/style-guide-base) and submit new prompt-output pairs. The model improves as the dataset grows."
  - question: "Does it only work with IBM style?"  
    answer: "While it's trained on IBM-style examples, the structure applies to any minimalist, clear technical writing. The framework is extensible to other style guides."
  - question: "Are there plans for a UI or plugin?"  
    answer: "Yes. A Gradio interface is already live, and a VS Code extension is under development. Stay updated via [GitHub](https://github.com/gtrivedi88) or [BeingTechnicalWriter.com](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com)."
  - question: "How can I train this for my company's specific documentation needs?"
    answer: "The training process is highly adaptable. Using techniques covered in my API Documentation Masterclass, you can customize the model for your organization's unique style guide and technical terminology. The same data preparation approach works whether you're documenting APIs, ML systems, or traditional software."

When I first talked about my [Part 1 of this journey](/model-training/), the assistant could only detect passive voice—covering roughly 30% of the most common style issues in technical documentation. It was helpful—but limited.

Now, it's so much more.

> **From detecting a single issue to handling five critical style rules.**

## The Vision: An AI That Understands Documentation Style

General grammar checkers aren't built for technical content. This AI assistant is.

It's trained on **thousands of real documentation corrections** made by writers, editors, and reviewers—covering rules like:

- Passive to active conversion  
- Redundancy reduction  
- Tone normalization  
- Wordy phrase rewrites  
- Ambiguity elimination  

> "The goal isn't to replace reviewers—it's to handle the repetitive, rule-based corrections automatically, so humans can focus on what matters."

## What's Inside?

Here's a snapshot of how far this has come:

## Try It Yourself

You can test the assistant in your own workflow with:

- **Model on Hugging Face**: [style-guide-checker](https://huggingface.co/gtrivedi/style-guide-checker)  
- **Dataset (15k+ examples)**: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gtrivedi88/style-guide-base/blob/master/resources/dataset_passive_to_active.json)  
- **Training Notebook**: [Colab Notebook](https://github.com/gtrivedi88/style-guide-base/blob/master/resources/style_guide_base.ipynb)  
- **Gradio-based UI**: `app.py` in the repo  


## Future Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Advanced Applications Beyond Style

Moving forward, I plan to extend the model to handle more complex documentation challenges. The techniques I'm exploring in my [AI/ML Documentation Course](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/aimldocumentation) will be particularly valuable for training the model to understand vector embeddings and knowledge graphs within technical content.

The goal is to create an assistant that can intelligently process [API specifications](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/apidocumentation) and ML model documentation, identifying not just style issues but also inconsistencies in technical accuracy. By applying the same training methodology developed for documentation style, we envision specialized models for validating API endpoint descriptions against OpenAPI schemas or ensuring ML model behavior is accurately documented.

### Phase 2: Extreme Rule Enforcement for Minimalist Documentation

The future iterations of this model will focus on enforcing even more sophisticated writing rules, particularly ones that separate merely good documentation from truly exceptional content:

1. **Future Tense Elimination** - Converting all future tense statements ("will happen") to present tense ("happens") for more direct, authoritative documentation

2. **Aggressive Minimalism** - Identifying and removing every unnecessary word, aiming for the absolute minimum word count without losing meaning

3. **Technical Precision Enhancement** - Detecting vague technical descriptions and replacing them with exact, measurable statements

4. **Contextual Word Choice** - Understanding domain-specific terminology and suggesting the most appropriate terms based on the technical context

These advanced rules build on the foundation established in the current release but push the boundaries of what's possible with AI-assisted technical writing. The techniques explored in my API Documentation and AI/ML Documentation courses will be further refined to train these more sophisticated rule sets.
