faqs:
  - question: "What is Cursor AI and how does it differ from VS Code?"
    answer: "Cursor AI is an AI-powered fork of Visual Studio Code that integrates large language model capabilities directly into the editor. While it maintains VS Code's familiar interface and functionality, Cursor adds advanced AI features like real-time code generation, refactoring suggestions, and natural language command processing. It enables developers and technical writers to accomplish complex coding tasks through simple prompts rather than manual implementation."
  - question: "Is Cursor AI free to use?"
    answer: "Cursor AI offers both free and paid tiers. The free version provides access to the editor and basic AI functionality with some usage limits. For more intensive use, Cursor offers a Pro subscription that includes higher rate limits, priority access to newer AI models, and additional features. For most documentation projects like the one described in this article, the free tier is sufficient."
  - question: "Do I need coding experience to use Cursor AI effectively?"
    answer: "While some coding knowledge is helpful to understand and modify the AI's output, Cursor AI can be valuable even for those with limited coding experience. Technical writers with basic HTML/CSS familiarity can use natural language prompts to generate and modify code without needing to write it from scratch. However, the ability to review and understand generated code remains important for troubleshooting and maintenance."
  - question: "Is it safe to use Cursor AI for proprietary or sensitive content?"
    answer: "Cursor AI processes your code through cloud-based language models, which raises potential privacy concerns for proprietary or sensitive content. While Cursor has privacy policies in place, users working with confidential information should review these policies and consider using Cursor's local models when available. For public-facing content like documentation websites, privacy concerns are generally less critical."
  - question: "Can Cursor AI help with other technical writing tasks besides website development?"
    answer: "Yes, Cursor AI can assist with various technical writing tasks beyond website development. It can help generate code samples for documentation, create testing scripts, develop interactive elements for tutorials, format complex technical content, convert between markup languages, and even help troubleshoot existing documentation code. Its ability to understand natural language makes it particularly useful for technical writers who need to implement code-based solutions."

As a technical writer, I talk a lot about **clarity, usability, and well-structured documentation**. But when I looked at my **[own API documentation course](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/apidocumentation) website**, I had to admitâ€”it was more of a cautionary tale than an example of best practices.  

The **mobile view was a mess**. The **layout felt outdated**. Code blocks? They **spilled out of their containers like an overflowing coffee cup**. Tables? **Broken.**  

I needed a **fix**, and I needed it **yesterday**. That's when I stumbled upon **Cursor AI**â€”an **AI-powered fork of VS Code** that promised to **improve my coding workflow**. It looked like VS Code, felt like VS Code, but came with **AI assistance that could generate, refactor, and optimize code in real time**.  

I decided to give it a shot. Here's what happened.  

## Setting up Cursor AI  

Getting Cursor AI up and running was **shockingly simple**â€”unlike debugging an API call at midnight.  

1. **Download Cursor AI** from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh).  
2. **Install and open it** (it looks almost identical to VS Code).  
3. **Go to settings** and log in (you'll need to create a free account).  
4. **Press `Ctrl + L`** to open the AI chat assistant.  
5. **Select `clause-3.7-sonet`**, and that's itâ€”you're ready to roll!  

It felt like opening a brand-new notebookâ€”except this one could actually help me write.

<!-- AddTitleOne -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7149683584202371"
     data-ad-slot="7422872052"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

## Creating a responsive template  

Since my course teaches **how to write clean, structured API documentation**, my website should reflect that. I asked Cursor AI:  

> **"Create a responsive template for an API documentation course website."**  

In seconds, it generated:  
- A **well-structured HTML layout** with modern best practices.  
- **Clean, modular CSS** that didn't look like it had been assembled in a hurry.  
- **Built-in responsiveness** so I wouldn't have to play whack-a-mole with breakpoints.  

For the first time, my website looked like something I wouldn't mind showing off.  

## Optimizing for mobile  

If you've ever tried making a website **mobile-friendly**, you know it's like trying to fit a week's worth of groceries into a tiny fridgeâ€”you *can* do it, but not without some strategic rearranging.  

I prompted Cursor AI:  

> **"Optimize my content for readability and mobile responsiveness."**  

It **analyzed my CSS**, probably sighed in disappointment, and then:  
- **Added media queries** to keep text from spilling out of containers.  
- **Resized buttons and links** so users didn't need surgeon-level precision to tap them.  
- **Adjusted font scaling** for a better reading experience on all devices.  

Now, users on mobile **could actually read the content** without pinching, zooming, or sighing in frustration.  

## Before & after  

Move the slider below to **compare the before and after versions of my website** using Cursor AI.

<div class="before-after-container">
    <div class="image-slider">
        <div class="image-wrapper">
            <img src="/assets/before.png" alt="Before Optimization" class="before-img">
            <div class="after-img-wrapper">
                <img src="/assets/after.png" alt="After Optimization" class="after-img">
            </div>
        </div>
        <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="50" class="slider" id="slider">
    </div>
</div>

<style>
.before-after-container {
    text-align: center;
    margin: 20px auto;
    max-width: 800px;
    position: relative;
}

.image-slider {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 800px;
    overflow: hidden;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.image-wrapper {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
}

.before-img {
    width: 100%;
    display: block;
}

.after-img-wrapper {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.after-img {
    width: 100%;
    display: block;
    clip-path: inset(0 50% 0 0);
    transition: clip-path 0.1s ease-in-out;
}

.slider {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 500px;
    margin-top: 10px;
    cursor: pointer;
}
</style>

<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    const slider = document.getElementById("slider");
    const afterImg = document.querySelector(".after-img");

    slider.addEventListener("input", function () {
        let value = slider.value;
        afterImg.style.clipPath = `inset(0 ${100 - value}% 0 0)`;
    });
});
</script>

## The not-so-great parts  

While Cursor AI is **impressively powerful**, it's not without its quirks.  

1. **Code ownership & transparency** â€“ It **modifies your existing code in real-time**, but if you donâ€™t know how to read code, you wonâ€™t know **what itâ€™s changing, where, or why**.  

2. **Troubleshooting nightmare** â€“ If something **suddenly stops working**, debugging can be a headache because **you didnâ€™t write the codeâ€”it did**.  

3. **Dependency on AI** â€“ While Cursor AI speeds up development, **blind reliance** can lead to poor understanding of best practices.  

4. **Privacy concerns** â€“ Your code is processed by an AI assistant, so **if youâ€™re working on something sensitive**, you might want to think twice.  

## Should you use Cursor AI?  

Cursor AI is **a game-changer for technical writers and developers** who want to **streamline workflows, improve responsiveness, and fix code issues quickly**.  

But, like any tool, **itâ€™s only as good as the user**. If you can **read and understand what itâ€™s doing**, it can be a lifesaver. If not, you might end up with a website that worksâ€”until it doesnâ€™t.  

That being said, **if you're working on API documentation, technical writing, or web development, give Cursor AI a shot**. It might just save your **sanityâ€”and your website.**  

And if youâ€™re looking to **[learn API documentation](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/apidocumentation)** the right way, wellâ€¦ I happen to know a certain website thatâ€™s now beautifully responsive. ðŸ˜‰
