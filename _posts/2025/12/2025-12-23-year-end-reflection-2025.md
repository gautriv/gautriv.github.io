faqs:
  - question: "What AI courses should technical writers take?"
    answer: "Andrew Ng's AI Agentic courses on DeepLearning.AI are essential for understanding how AI agents work. These courses help you understand agents, orchestration, and autonomy—fundamentally shifting how you think about AI's role in documentation workflows."
  - question: "How is AI changing technical writing in 2025?"
    answer: "AI has shifted from being a separate initiative to being absorbed into everything. Tools like Cursor, Claude, and Gemini now touch documentation, reviews, ideation, and validation—sometimes invisibly. The real differentiator is no longer productivity but judgment."
  - question: "Will AI replace technical writers by 2026?"
    answer: "Technical writing won't disappear, but thoughtless writing will. People who treat AI as a shortcut will plateau. People who treat it as a lens will compound. The more automated things become, the more human discernment matters."
  - question: "What is Content Editorial Assistant (CEA)?"
    answer: "CEA is an AI-powered tool trained on style guides to assist with peer review processes. Instead of relying on reviewers to memorize and interpret style guidelines consistently, CEA removes memory and interpretation from the equation—providing automated, consistent feedback."

I keep a folder on my desktop called "Screenshots I'll Need Later."

It has 347 images.

I needed exactly five of them this year.

<div class="metaphor-callout">
That folder is a metaphor for 2025.

We collected everything.
We processed almost nothing.
And somehow, we ended up somewhere completely different from where we started.
</div>

This was supposed to be the year I got organized.

Instead, it became the year I had to fundamentally reconsider what my job even *is*.

<div class="opening-statement">
<p>This year didn't knock.</p>
<p>It kicked the door open.</p>
</div>

One day, you were confident in your craft. The next day, your tool was talking back—suggesting, correcting, sometimes outperforming you.

If this year felt intense, confusing, exciting, and slightly exhausting...good.

That means you were paying attention.

For me, this year became a deep learning experience in the truest sense of the phrase. Not just machine learning—but *human* learning.

It started with a bang. And somehow… it managed to end with one too.

## The year of building (and rebuilding) muscle memory

<div class="metaphor-callout">
Some years teach you skills.

Some years teach you humility.
</div>

This one did both.

Outside of regular work, this year was about experimentation. While taking one of Andrew Ng's AI courses, a thought kept returning:

<div class="thought-callout">
What if I actually tried to apply this instead of just understanding it?
</div>

Learning without experimentation felt incomplete. So I decided to run an experiment—one that would force me to learn, unlearn, and occasionally feel uncomfortable.

I went looking for a real problem. It didn't take long.

## A problem everyone endures and no one enjoys

Peer and editorial review.

<div class="problem-grid">
  <div class="problem-item">Manual</div>
  <div class="problem-item">Subjective</div>
  <div class="problem-item">Exhausting</div>
</div>

Everyone was expected to remember the style guide. Everyone was expected to interpret it the same way. Most never did.

That's when a simple thought appeared:

<div class="idea-callout">
Why not train a model on the style guide itself?
</div>

Not to replace reviewers. But to remove memory and interpretation from the equation.

That was the beginning of **Content Editorial Assistant (CEA)**.

<div class="cea-card">
  <div class="cea-header">
    <span class="cea-badge">Built in 2025</span>
    <h4>Content Editorial Assistant</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="cea-evolution">
    <div class="evolution-stage">
      <div class="stage-label">Before</div>
      <div class="stage-desc">An experiment. A "nice idea."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="evolution-arrow">→</div>
    <div class="evolution-stage">
      <div class="stage-label">After</div>
      <div class="stage-desc">A system. Quiet reliability.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="cea-lesson">
    <p>Less hype. More discipline. Fewer "wow" moments—and more of the kind that survives real workflows.</p>
  </div>
</div>

CEA stopped being an experiment and started behaving like a system.

That shift mattered. Because tools that work in theory are easy to build. Tools that survive reality are rare.

## PyCon India, STC India, and the power of shared confusion

Presenting CEA at PyCon India and STC India surfaced something important.

Conferences this year weren't about answers. They were about admitting uncertainty—*together*.

The most honest conversations didn't happen on stage. They happened in hallways, over coffee, and in slightly uncomfortable pauses where someone finally said:

<div class="quote-callout">
"I'm not sure how this will change my job… but I know it will."
</div>

That honesty was refreshing.

## A note on STC India

STC India stood out. It was a full house and an eager audience. By the end, three things became very clear:

<div class="stc-takeaways">
  <div class="stc-item">
    <div class="stc-number">01</div>
    <div class="stc-content">
      <strong>Everything was about AI</strong>
      <p>Not just in talk, but in experimentation. The shift from theory to practice was everywhere.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="stc-item">
    <div class="stc-number">02</div>
    <div class="stc-content">
      <strong>Much of the curiosity was driven by fear</strong>
      <p>Not curiosity for novelty, but fear of irrelevance and job loss. The motivation behind the learning mattered.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="stc-item">
    <div class="stc-number">03</div>
    <div class="stc-content">
      <strong>Community matters more than ever</strong>
      <p>In uncertain times, people don't look for tools first. They look for each other.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Learning at an uncomfortable speed

Yes, there was work. Yes, multiple new things were happening at the office.
But somewhere between deadlines and curiosity, I managed to complete a few AI courses—especially the ones by Andrew Ng on AI Agents, along with another that pushed my thinking even further.

<div class="courses-grid">
  <div class="course-card">
    <div class="course-badge">Completed</div>
    <h5>AI Agents in LangGraph</h5>
    <p>Multi-agent systems. Planning. Execution. Iteration.</p>
    <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph/" class="course-link" target="_blank">DeepLearning.AI →</a>
  </div>
  <div class="course-card">
    <div class="course-badge">Completed</div>
    <h5>Building Agentic RAG</h5>
    <p>How AI retrieves and reasons over documentation.</p>
    <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-agentic-rag-with-llamaindex/" class="course-link" target="_blank">DeepLearning.AI →</a>
  </div>
</div>

And by the end of it, I realized an uncomfortable truth.

<div class="uncomfortable-truth">
The courses weren't hard.

Accepting what they implied was.
</div>

Once you understand agents, orchestration, and autonomy, you stop asking *if* AI will change work.

You start asking *who adapts fast enough*. That question doesn't come with a syllabus.

## Work didn't "adopt" AI — it absorbed it

By mid-year, something subtle happened. AI stopped being a separate initiative. It leaked into everything.

<div class="absorption-grid">
  <div class="absorption-item">
    <span class="absorption-tool">Cursor</span>
    <span class="absorption-effect">quietly reshaping how we code</span>
  </div>
  <div class="absorption-item">
    <span class="absorption-tool">Claude</span>
    <span class="absorption-effect">becoming a thinking partner</span>
  </div>
  <div class="absorption-item">
    <span class="absorption-tool">Gemini</span>
    <span class="absorption-effect">stepping into analysis and synthesis</span>
  </div>
  <div class="absorption-item">
    <span class="absorption-tool">AI everywhere</span>
    <span class="absorption-effect">documentation, reviews, ideation, validation—often invisibly</span>
  </div>
</div>

No big announcement.

No victory lap.

Just… integration.

And with it, discomfort.

## The real trouble (that no one has an answer for)

Here's the part no keynote wants to dwell on:

<div class="core-truth">
Productivity is no longer the differentiator.

<strong>Judgment is.</strong>
</div>

AI made output cheap.

Speed abundant.

Polish trivial.

So what's left?

<div class="whats-left">
  <div class="left-item"><span>Taste</span></div>
  <div class="left-item"><span>Context</span></div>
  <div class="left-item"><span>Responsibility</span></div>
  <div class="left-item"><span>Knowing when <em>not</em> to generate</span></div>
  <div class="left-item"><span>Understanding consequences beyond the prompt</span></div>
</div>

There is no model for that yet.

No roadmap either.

<div class="defining-feature">
That uncertainty isn't a bug of this era.

It's the defining feature.
</div>

## So… how do you stay relevant?

I don't have a definitive answer for this. But one thing is for sure, AI worshiping won't help. May be we can stay relevant by doing the unglamorous work:

<div class="relevance-list">
  <div class="relevance-item">
    <span class="relevance-arrow">→</span>
    <span>Thinking clearly when tools get noisy</span>
  </div>
  <div class="relevance-item">
    <span class="relevance-arrow">→</span>
    <span>Building systems, not demos</span>
  </div>
  <div class="relevance-item">
    <span class="relevance-arrow">→</span>
    <span>Asking better questions instead of faster ones</span>
  </div>
  <div class="relevance-item">
    <span class="relevance-arrow">→</span>
    <span>Understanding <em>why</em> something works—not just <em>that</em> it does</span>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="irony-callout">
Ironically, the more automated things become, the more human discernment matters.
</div>

## What 2026 quietly looks like

Prediction is always risky, but there’s growing consensus among AI and technical communication experts about how technical writing will evolve.

AI won’t make technical writers obsolete, it will make the role more strategic and less repetitive. Current research and industry voices suggest that AI automates structure, formatting, and first-draft generation, but it still struggles with context, correctness, empathy, persona, and domain nuance.



<div class="future-cards">
  <div class="future-card plateau">
    <div class="future-label">Will plateau</div>
    <p>People who treat AI as a shortcut</p>
  </div>
  <div class="future-card compound">
    <div class="future-label">Will compound</div>
    <p>People who treat AI as a lens</p>
  </div>
</div>

Technical writing won't disappear. But thoughtless writing will... and that's probably a good thing.

## The folder on my desktop

I still have that "Screenshots I'll Need Later" folder.

Still 347 images.

Still only needed five.

But I learned something.

<div class="lesson-pair">
  <div class="lesson">Collecting isn't understanding.</div>
  <div class="lesson">Hoarding isn't preparing.</div>
</div>

The screenshots I actually needed weren't flashy demos or bold announcements.

They were small moments:

<div class="small-moments">
  <div class="moment">A slide showing real user research.</div>
  <div class="moment">A diagram mapping documentation into product development.</div>
  <div class="moment">A whiteboard photo where a team wrestled with information architecture.</div>
</div>

The human stuff.

The thinking stuff.

The *why* behind the *what*.

2025 broke my brain with questions I couldn't answer.

2026 will probably break it again and that's okay.

<div class="healing-line">
Healing is just learning in disguise.
</div>

<div class="closing-mirror">
<p>So yes, this year didn't knock.</p>
<p>It still doesn't.</p>
<p>But here's the difference—<strong>we're no longer pretending we didn't hear it.</strong></p>
</div>

This year didn’t just teach us new tools.
It taught us what can’t be automated away.

And if that realization felt uncomfortable at times, it means the year did exactly what it was supposed to do.

Here’s to learning that sticks.
And to the questions worth carrying into the next year.

Wishing you a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year!
