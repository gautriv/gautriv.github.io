Last week, I found myself in a bit of a pickle. I received a PDF from one of my banks which was password-protected. The email instructed me to use my account number to open the document, but it didn't specify which account number. After trying various combinations to no avail, I turned to the web for a solution to unlock my file.

I tried the top 5 search results for "unlock PDF," but most of them were disappointing. Some sounded promising but then asked for the password. I was like, "Come on! If I knew the password, why would I need you?" Moving on to the next results, I finally found one that could unlock my PDF, but then it hit me with a paywall—over $20 to view the unlocked version! Another dampener.

In this day and age of AI, I thought, why not create something that can help me—and others—unlock PDF files for free? Thus, the **PDF Password Brute Force Tool** was born. It's a simple, effective, and free tool to remove PDF passwords online.

```

### Step 3: Install dependencies
Now, let’s get those necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the application

```bash
python app.py

    - **Type of characters in password**: Choose from Numbers, Alphabets, or Alphanumeric.

## Estimated Processing Time

Patience is a virtue, especially when unlocking PDFs. Depending on the length and complexity of the password, the time required to unlock the PDF can vary:

- **Short Numeric Passwords (1-4 characters)**: A few seconds to a minute.
- **Longer Numeric or Simple Alphabetic Passwords (5-6 characters)**: Several minutes to hours.
- **Complex Alphanumeric Passwords**: Could take from minutes to more than a couple of hours.

Just sit tight and let the tool do its thing. Go grab a coffee, take a stroll, or binge-watch your favorite series. The tool will notify you once it’s done.
